## Modeling the public transport network in Milan: an ABM Approach

* 0_preliminary_steps.ipynb - This notebook contains some data cleaning and data manipulation that were undertaken in order to build the network for our model.

* 1_network_generation.ipynb - This notebook contains the generation process of the graph and the creation of the minute-by-minute timetable.

* 2_agents_model_final.ipynb - This notebook contains the creation of the model, which consists of: the method for the generation of the sythetic population, the Agent class, the model, a function to run a simulation from start to finish, several functions for the analysis of the simulation's results.

* killing_agents.py - This is an auxiliary file for the easy import of all functions defined in previous notebooks.

* Experiment_1.ipynb - This notebook contains the creation of the network for experiment 1, the simulation itself and the analysis of the results.

* Experiment_2.ipynb - This notebook contains the creation of the network for experiment 2, the simulation itself and the analysis of the results.
